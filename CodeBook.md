The subjects are numbered from 1-30.
The activities are:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
All of the other variables were calculated in the upstream analysis.
The variables beginning "t" are time variables
The variables beginning "f" are frequency variables (after FFT applied)
The variables ending in "X" "Y" or "Z" refer to the coordinate axes
I don't know what the units are on any of these.
